Customer Behaviour:
	1. They stand in line outside (outside camera view) and comes in at random interval
	(perhaps a range from 10s to 20s).

	2. They may come in stack of 1 to 4.

	3. Once inside, they randomly choose from any available table, then sit on chairs 
	around it.

	4. Once seated, they place a random tea order.
	
	5. They will wait for their order for as long as `min_wait_time` happily then grow 	increasingly agitated as it approaches `max_wait_time`. They will leave if it 
	they have been waiting longer than `max_wait_time`.

	6. While they wait and drink, they will have pop up messages and icons, conveying
	how they feel about the tea, the service, the appearance of the place, etc...
	and their small dialogues will be AI Generated for uniqueness.

	7. Once they finish drinking their tea, they have a pop-up of their mood then, they
	will immediately get up and leave.

	8. While a table is occupier, no other customer may take their table until they are 
	done. That also means if all tables are occupied, no new customer may enter the cafe.
