Problems that requires fixing eventually:

1. Customer Browsing Logic: Customers should naturally look around the cafe decoration before approaching 
   the counter. (TLDR: Implement a more realistic browsing behavior)
2. Queue Management: Customers should ignore browsing customers when lining up 
   instead of saving their position in line for the.
3. Order Customization: Allow customers to customize their orders (e.g., adding extra ingredients, etc...)

Plans and Optiions regarding Assets:
1. Use Pixel-Art textures for walls and floors to give the cafe a cozy and retro feel.
2. Use Voxel-style furniture and decor (or any complicated shapes) to maintain a consistent aesthetic.
3. Use Pixel-Art sprites for customers and staff to match the overall theme.
4. Implement simple animations for customer actions (e.g., walking, ordering, eating) to enhance immersion.
