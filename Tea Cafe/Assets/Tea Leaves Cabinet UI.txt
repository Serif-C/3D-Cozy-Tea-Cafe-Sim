Tea Leaves Cabinet UI:
1. When the player interacts with the cabinet, a UI pops-up
2. The player can select which tea leaf to get from the cabinet indicated by their icons
3. When the mouse is hovered on a cabinet drawer, it gets highlighted
4. When a highlighted drawer is clicked, it opens, and the player can take the desired tea leaf.

Logic Flow:
1. Interacting with the Cabinet game object actives the Cabinet UI.
2. The cabinet UI is divided into several rectangles, each containing various information.
3. A cabinet stores: 1) Highlight sprite, 2) Cabinet Open Sprite, 3) The Tea leaf itself.
4. When the mouse is hovered over a cabinet, it's sprite switches to its Highlight Sprite.
5. When a cabinet is clicked, its sprite switches to its Cabinet Open Sprite.
6. If the cabinet is open (this must be true) then the player can click the opened cabinet to take the desired Tea Leaf.
