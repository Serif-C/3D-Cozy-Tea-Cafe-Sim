Core Gameplay
- Slow and cozy
- Customers come in managable intervals
- Customers sit down to dine while they either socialize with their group or if they are solo (read a book)
- If the cafe is full, customers either line up, or browse around the cafe's lounge section
- The player's motivation for playing is to improve the appearance of their cafe and unlock more features
- Unlockable features such as:
	1. Pets (think of a way to incorporate this)
	2. Autopilot Workers
	3. Shop Items
	4. Sea kings (or other big creatures outside the cafe if going the Non-Baratie route)

how to gamify cozy tea cafe sim
1. Customers should feel expressive (show a bunch of emotes while drinking their order)
2. Customer arrival should be based on time (chill hours and busy hours)
3. Enhance visual feedback by highlighting interactables
4. Create player shop where coin can be spent
5. Enhance build mode to allow the cafe to be expanded and upgraded
6. More visual upgrades such as adding water
7. Expand order menu
8. Animate objects, customers, players
9. Customers should be social entities: They can be interacted with and they should also interact with their surroundings

Gameplayloop-wise it should be something like:
- You start with basic Tea orders with prep - serve looking like:
	1. Boil Water
	2. Pick correct leaf
	3. Chop leaf
	4. Brew tea (boiled water + chopped leaf)
	5. Serve

- Then as the game continues (probably after a couple in-game days), customers start
  to place more complex orders requiring more steps (such as smoothies or bobas):
	1. Boil Water
	2. Pick correct leaf
	3. Chop leaf
	4. Brew tea (boiled water + chopped leaf)
	5. Pick up ice pack
	6. Blend ice + brewed tea
	7. Serve

- Then maybe some pastry options too etc...

- Seasonal menu should also be a thing

- Non-seasonal menu should always be available to order

These added tasks and complexity are the motivation behind expanding the cafe and hiring workers.
