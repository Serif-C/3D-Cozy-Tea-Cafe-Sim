how to gamify cozy tea cafe sim
1. Customers should feel expressive (show a bunch of emotes while drinking their order)
2. Customer arrival should be based on time (chill hours and busy hours)
3. Enhance visual feedback by highlighting interactables
4. Create player shop where coin can be spent
5. Enhance build mode to allow the cafe to be expanded and upgraded
6. More visual upgrades such as adding water
7. Expand order menu
8. Animate objects, customers, players

Gameplayloop-wise it should be something like:
- You start with basic Tea orders with prep - serve looking like:
	1. Boil Water
	2. Pick correct leaf
	3. Chop leaf
	4. Brew tea (boiled water + chopped leaf)
	5. Serve

- Then as the game continues (probably after a couple in-game days), customers start
  to place more complex orders requiring more steps (such as smoothies or bobas):
	1. Boil Water
	2. Pick correct leaf
	3. Chop leaf
	4. Brew tea (boiled water + chopped leaf)
	5. Pick up ice pack
	6. Blend ice + brewed tea
	7. Serve

- Then maybe some pastry options too etc...

- Seasonal menu should also be a thing

- Non-seasonal menu should always be available to order

These added tasks and complexity are the motivation behind expanding the cafe and hiring workers.


ANOTHER IDEA:
- When performing interactable actions in the kitchen, go into 1st-person view then perform the action:
	Example:
	Chopping Tea Leaves - go into first person view and chop by dragging knife in a certain motion.

- With this idea, customers must wait for their order to be taken at the front of the server before
  being able to choose/sit on a table.
